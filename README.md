# vue-shopping-list

This is a basic web app created using Javascript and the Vue framework.

The app allows the user to enter a name for the shopping list, and provides
the ability to change the name of the list. Users can add to the list the
name, the SKU, and the price of each item. Items may be removed from the list.

I plan to add additional functionality to the app, and to improve the styling.
